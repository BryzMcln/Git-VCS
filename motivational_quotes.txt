"Wake up to reality! Nothing ever goes as planned in this acursed world. The longer you live, the more you realize that in this reality only pain, suffering, and futility exist. The longer you live, the more you realize the only thing that truly exists in this reality is the willpower and the raw strength needed to overcome it all." - MADARA UCHIHA
